                Why did I choose to learn coding ?
            </h2>
            <h3>
                I think we live in the world of transparency and honesty so 
                I won't deny that my main objective of learning coding and web development is 
                the improvement of my economic situation.
                However, that is not the only reason. My Hope is that I'll have the privilege of making a 
                difference in the world through my knowledge of programing. 
                Maybe I inherited this conviction from my years as a high school teacher. 
                But making the world a better place is a large concept. 
                I intend to focus my efforts on what I think is the greatest challenge of 
                our generation and future generations as well: 
                To fight the disastrous effects of climate change and reduce the CO2 emissions 
                of human activity.
                There is nothing more important in my views than this enormous challenge.

                My educational and professional career:
            </h2>
            <h3>
                Throughout my professional and academic journey, I have traversed diverse paths, 
                with a predominant focus on the field of education. In 2007 I was 
                enlisted into the National Israeli Police, where I proudly served as an instructor at 
                the National Police Academy.

                Following my military service, I studied law at Bar-Ilan University, earning both
                 a BA in Law and a Master degree in General Philosophy. I 
                subsequently dedicated my efforts to a legal internship with the Association of Civil Rights in Israel.

                However, a pivotal moment led me to redirect my professional trajectory towards the study and 
                teaching of the Arabic language. I firmly believed, and still do, that acquiring another culture's language 
                plays a crucial role in promoting peace and fostering mutual understanding among its people. Over the past 
                four years, I have embraced the role of a high school teacher in various high schools in Israel.
